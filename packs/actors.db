first time you see those hollow sockets staring back at you with some semblance of thought inside the skull, I advise to quash any feelings of accomplishment.  The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.  Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.  Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant's tasks with exceeding care.  Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.  The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br /><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.  The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.  Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.  The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.  With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master's will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.  Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.  The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.  Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.  One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.  Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.  Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author's Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer's journey will be humanoid.  Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant’s eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant’s original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse.

When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Divine Justice.</strong></em> No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant’s body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Undead Nature.</strong></em> A revenant doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>VARIANT: REVENANTS WITH SPELLS AND WEAPONS</strong></p>\n<p>Revenants that were spellcasters before they died might retain some or all of their spellcasting capabilities.

A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Jerald","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"modules/darakhul-awaken/tokens/commoner.Token.webp","actorId":"SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/clubs/club-simple-barbed.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.
